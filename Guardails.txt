Create an initial README.md which gives a paragraphy summary of the project as a whole, as well as a feature list, getting started, and controls at the first push commit to GitHub.
the README.md header should always be the same as the repository name. 
Update the README.md before each push commit to GitHub to include any major new features, getting started, or controls; don't update the README.md with minor changes.
Don't keep track of the git commit after each instruction or git diff cacheing, only check changes when merging and pushing to git.
